A few notes:

- The texture image I use is from Imgur, so there is no image file in the project.
- The texture on the bottom half of the sphere (at its original orientation) doesn't generate correctly. I spent many frustrated hours trying to figure out why this was happening and I couldn't, so I apologize.
