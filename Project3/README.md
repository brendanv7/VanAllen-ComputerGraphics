A few notes:

- I broke the normal-based shader into two separate files, one that does the shading per-vertex (normalVertSphere.html) and one that does the shading per-fragment (normalFragSphere.html)
- I chose the artistic shading for my custom shader, but I couldn't figure out to draw the silhouettes, so it is only cool-to-warm shading.
