# Project 2: Ray-Tracer
My project has a few bugs that I was unable to resolve in time for submission, so I apologize.
- The Y-axis appears to be getting flipped somehow (Gray sphere has Y coord of (-1), but appears above the rest which have Y coord of 0)
- I'm still not sure if I am orienting the Z-axis correctly

Notes:
- The project currently outputs a PNG image, but I tried with both PNG and JPEG so one example of each is contained the root project folder.
